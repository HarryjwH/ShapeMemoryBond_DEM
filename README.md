# ShapeMemoryBond_DEM
This repository contains the subroutine code for calculating bond bending deformation of shape memory rod-like particles based on Ref.[1]. The shape-memory behaviors with temperature variation have been considered in the calculations.   

For a complete simulation of the shape memory rods using the Discrete Element Method (DEM), the present subroutine code should be incorporated into a DEM code for the modeling of flexible fibrous particles as described in Ref.[2].
